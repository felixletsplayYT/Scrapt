# Scrapt
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rfeoi/Scrapt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rfeoi/Scrapt)
## What is Scrapt?
Scrapt is a tool for creating your own Minigames with and without Java. It is inspired by Scratch/Snap.
## How can I use Scrapt?
Currently there are two ways to use Scrapt:
As script Language and as Java API.
Both can be used with one File (scrapt.jar).
## How can I use the Java API?
Link the jar File to your project. 
Or clone repository and do ``mvn install`` and add Scrapt as maven dependency.
An example, for using the library, can be found [here](https://github.com/rfeoi/Scrapt-Examples).
## How can I use the script language?
In the Wiki you can find the documentation of the script language.
[Here](https://github.com/rfeoi/Scrapt-Examples) you can find an example.
## Where can I submit an Issue/Idea

## Can I contribute to this Project.
You can just fork the Project, do your things and create a Pull Request.
We fork this, if it is well written, compatible with the project and useful.
## Which java version should I use?
We use Oracle JDK 8 for building and coding.
All commits are build by Oracle JDK 8,9,10 and by OpenJDK 8.
We do not support them, if they cause any issues use Oracle JDK 8 for Scrapt.
All we know is that JDK 7 does not work.
